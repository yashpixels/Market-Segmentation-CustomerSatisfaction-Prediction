# Market-Segmentation-CustomerSatisfaction-Prediction
Factor Analysis, Regression Analysis, Interpretation

This dataset will be used for market segmentation in the context of product service management. 
Our objective starts with doing exploratory analysis of the dataset using R Language. 
We will start with checking whether the variables in the datasets have any significant correlation among each other 
(Testing multicollinearity using correlation matrix and VIF concept) which will help us determine if there is any 
possibility to reduce the dimensions and apply principal component analysis/factor analysis. Based on our findings,
we will proceed with linear regression of each independent variable with the dependent variable “Satisfaction” to 
understand the linear trend. We will further apply PCA/FA to create 4 factors and use those factors to do a multiple linear regression,
with our dependent variable “Satisfaction” and interpret our findings appropriately.
